    PeakStorm is a lightweight web application that estimates the isotopic 
    envelope of a protein based on the most intense peak. Using the 
    **Averagine model** proposed by Senko et al. in *"Determination of 
    Monoisotopic Masses and Ion Populations for Large Biomolecules from 
    Resolved Isotopic Distributions,"* it computes the isotope distribution 
    from the molecular weight.

    Features:  
    âœ” Computes isotopic distribution from a given peak intensity  
    âœ” Uses the well-established Averagine model for accuracy  
    âœ” Visualizes the isotopic envelope in an interactive plot  
    âœ” Allows download of results in TSV and Excel format  

    Fast. Accurate. Intuitive. ðŸš€
